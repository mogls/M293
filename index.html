            </div>
            <p id="p1">
                You will need jam tart/fairy cake tins or, better still, pastel de nata tins, plus
                oil to grease them. Start with the syrup for the custard. Put the sugar in a small
                pan with 150ml water, half the cinnamon stick and half the lemon strips. Bring to a
                boil and cook until slightly thickened – it’s ready when it hits about 107C.
            </p>
            <p id="p2">
                If you don’t have a thermometer, run a teaspoon under cold water, then put a little
                syrup on to it and, when it’s cool enough, pinch it between two fingers: it should
                form a thin thread when you draw them apart. Take off the heat and leave to infuse
                (this can be done the day before). Put the flour and salt in a bowl and stir
                briefly. Add the water, and stir with one hand until it just comes together into a
                dry dough.
            </p>
            <p id="p3">
                Turn out on to a clean surface and knead until smooth. If the dough is stubbornly
                flaky, wet your hands to do this, but try not to add more water unless it’s
                absolutely necessary. Wrap and chill for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the butter into
                small, flat tiles. Cut out two rectangles of greaseproof paper, and draw a 15cm x
                20cm rectangle in the middle of one of them.
            </p>
            <p id="p4">
                Arrange the tiles of butter in a tight rectangle in the centre of the other piece of
                paper, then put the other sheet on top drawing side up and roll out the butter
                between the two sheets until it roughly fills the drawn rectangle.
            </p>
            <p id="p5">
                Put the butter and its paper in the fridge. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured
                surface to about the same size as the butter rectangle, then, keeping this central
                rectangle thicker, roll or stretch out the sides so you end up with a cross shape,
                with four thin arms and a thick, butter-sized rectangle in the centre.
            </p>
            <p id="p6">
                Peel the paper off the butter, then lay it in the centre of the cross and fold the
                arms over the top, so they completely enclose the butter.
            </p>
            <p id="p7">
                Roll out the dough rectangle to about three times its original length, then fold the
                top third down into the middle and the bottom third up over the top. Turn the dough
                90 degrees, then repeat the roll and fold process. Wrap and chill for 20 minutes,
                then roll out for a final time to a ½cm-thick rectangle that’s about 20cm x 35cm.
            </p>
            <p id="p8">
                With the long side facing you, roll up very tightly into a long sausage and wrap
                well (you may find it easier to cut it in two before wrapping). Chill for at least
                an hour. Put the milk in a medium pan with 10g of the butter, the other half of the
                cinnamon stick and the remaining strips of lemon peel. Bring to just below a boil,
                then take off the heat and leave to infuse for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, put
                the flours in a heatproof jug.
            </p>
            <p id="p9">
                Remove the flavourings from the infused milk, then pour a little of it into the
                flour jug, whisking to dissolve the flours, until you have a smooth paste, then
                whisk in a little more, repeating until about half of the milk is in there. Return
                this to the pan, set it over a low heat and stir until the milk mix has thickened to
                the consistency of double cream. Take off the heat, stir in the remaining butter and
                almost all of the syrup, having first removed the flavourings, but keeping a couple
                of spoonfuls of syrup back for later. (You can make the custard up to this point the
                day before, if convenient.) When you are ready to bake, get the pastry out of the
                fridge to warm up slightly. Heat the oven to 260C conventional/gas 9 (the fan is not
                helpful here), or as high as your oven will go if less, and put two metal trays
                inside to heat up. Lightly grease your nata tins or shallow fairy cake/jam tart
                tins.
            </p>
            <p id="p10">
                Cut the pastry into roughly 17g slices, put each one in a tin or mould and use damp
                fingers to press it all the way up the sides and slightly proud of the top. Be
                careful not to squash the thicker top edge, because this will form the rim. Return
                to the fridge for 20 minutes.
            </p>
            <p id="p11">
                Beat the egg yolks into the custard and fill the cases by three-quarters with
                custard.
            </p>
            <p id="p12">
                Working quickly, put the tins on the hot sheets and bake for about 10 minutes, until
                the pastry is dark golden and the custard starting to brown in spots – you’ll need
                to judge by eye when they’re ready, because this very much depends on your oven.
            </p>
            <p id="p13">Brush lightly with the reserved syrup, if using, while still warm.</p>
